# Goal and learned
- In this pokedex project we create a full stack project from scratch to display all 151 pokemons and show their data.

- The goal of this page is to gather data from all activity trackers and compile all the information into one webpage. Information from Strava, Nike - Run Club, Asics - RunKeeper, UnderArmor - Map my Run, AllTrails, ect.

# Current State

- In this pokedex we currently list all 151 pokemons from json file in our models and display them on the index route with html and css

- Because strava doesn't use a standard api key and follow oauth2 and tokens for api calls. I had to write a function refreshed my access_key which expires every 6 hours
    
- To do this we will be utilizing the strava api app to get user activity data 
    
- hardships of api oauth2 authentication code and authorizations, tokens and token refresh
    - I have to generate authorization code from an oauth2 authorization page
<div align="center">
    <a href="https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=80013&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=read_all">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wMGwQUp.png" alt="Logo" width="250" height="250">
    </a>
</div>

- With the authorization page we mimic as if we were logging into an app that will use our authorization login 

- Once this authorization is done, users will be able to see activities with map data and a poly line of the specific data

- user will be able to see their average data points and highest data point
    - avg hr, avg pace, avg run, best miles, longest milage, 

- Atheletes need an easy to access website to view their atheletic activities across different plateforms and their visualization.

# Roadmap and future Implementations

- add authorization page so the user could import their peronal data on to the page
- add poly line to all user activities
- Create a roadmap of all the miles onto the map.
    - When user hovers/clicks a mile or activity it will highlight and zoom onto location on map
- add more data points from different apps
- change user interface.
- In progress: users will be able to login and authorize strava to allow me to use and propagated their own use data
- add more map styling and interactiveness


# User Story

- You just finished your marathon, run, or any activity and imported your data on strava. 
- now you want to see your data on a page 
- you click my Athelets views and authorize Atheletes view to connect to strave
- once that authorization is done your activity data propagates on the page
